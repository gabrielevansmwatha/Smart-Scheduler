# Smart-Scheduler
This project is a Smart Event Scheduler built using Flask (Backend) and React (Frontend) to efficiently manage and schedule events. The system supports fixed, recurring, and flexible events, ensuring that event conflicts are automatically detected and resolved.

Key Features:
âœ… Fixed Events â€“ Schedule events at a specific time without modifications.

âœ… Recurring Events â€“ Automatically repeat events based on a defined frequency.

âœ… Flexible Events â€“ Dynamically allocate time slots based on availability and priority.

âœ… Conflict Detection â€“ Prevents overlapping events and suggests available time slots.

âœ… CORS Enabled â€“ Ensures seamless communication between the backend (Flask) and frontend (React).

Tech Stack:

Backend: Flask (Python), Flask-CORS

Frontend: React, Axios

Database: (Optional - Can be extended with SQL/NoSQL storage)

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements:

User authentication & role management

Integration with external calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook)

AI-powered smart scheduling

ðŸ’¡ How to Use:

Clone the repository.

Run the Flask backend (python app.py).

Start the React frontend (npm start).

Add events and let the scheduler handle conflicts automatically
